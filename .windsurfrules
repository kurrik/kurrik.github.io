1. Code should be organized according to DDD principles.
2. A `spec.md` file is an architecture design which applies to that directory and all subdirectories.
3. If a `spec.md` file exists in a directory or parent directory you're working in, read it and make your changes according to the architecture.
4. If you substantially change or add to an architecture, make an update to `spec.md` to record your change.
5. Do NOT create `utils` directories.  Think about how the functions you're adding should be incorporated into the DDD model.
